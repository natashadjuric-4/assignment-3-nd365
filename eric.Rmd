## About me
- I am a Research Support Specialist and Ph.D. Student in the Soil and Crops Section in the School of Integrative Plant Sciences working under Dr. Matthew Ryan in the Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab 

- My research looks to advance sustainable pest and disease management practices in organic cropping systems. Specifically, I investigate novel technologies for weed management and how to reduce pest and disease pressure through cultural and mechanical management in organic field crops. 

- Prior to my current focus in agroecology and sustainable agriculture, my research focused on the evolution and ecology of obligate ant-plant mutualisms in the Peruvian Amazon and Papua New Guinea.  

- I love natural history and am especially enamored with invertebrates, trees, and edible (culinary) fungi.
